# flowers dataset CNN Pretrained Models xception transfer learning
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the the flowers dataset data set then after that I am doing classification on it using convolutional neural network (CNN) by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Making some conclusions about the data.
4. using transfer learning from Xception model to achieve high accuracy despite of the low number of samples in the training dataset.
